# How to publish a npm package

This is a quick tutorial on how you can publish your own npm package with minimal configuration. This will cover the basic setup, how npm works and how to ship good quality code.

The full tutorial can be found at my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@vmarchesin/ho-to-publish-a-npm-package-in-four-steps-2fd021b895e4).

You'll need the following packages:

* @babel/core
* babel-loader
* webpack
* webpack-cli

You can install all the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm i -D @babel/core babel-loader webpack webpack-cli
```
